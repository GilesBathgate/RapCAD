Introduction
------------

RapCAD is a Rapid prototyping CAD IDE for RepRap and RepStrap 3D printing
machines. RapCAD is published under the GPLv3 licence.

Unlike most CAD packages RapCAD is not GUI based. One of the things that you
often do when using a traditional CAD package, for example, is to create
temporary construction lines that you either delete or put on a layer that is
never used or seen. From another person's perspective, it's not always obvious
how you arrived at your final design. In the software industry, the vital role
of version control is that it allows the transcript of decisions made during
the design process to be recorded. RapCAD solves this problem by allowing
designs to be described with a modular scene description language. This not
only provides compatibility with traditional text-based source control
management software, but it also allows for the creation of re-usable component
modules that can be distributed as a design library.
